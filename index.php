          <p>L&R Technologies is an independent engineering firm specializing in Body structure and Exterior component development for the Automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Our deep understanding of the manufacturing processes is the foundation in utilizing multi-material construction with a special focus on highly efficient applications of Advanced High Strength Steels as well as extensive Exterior component development experience with a strong background in Automotive Glazing.</p>
          <p>Our mission is to be your ideal engineering partner by providing engineering expertise to your project. We’ve partnered with a leading steel manufacturer to work in parallel to bring the optimal solution tailored specifically for your requirements and constraints (as required). Our Exterior expertise in plastics and glazing provide solid engineering while incorporating an aesthetic quality with attention to fit and finish.</p>
          <p>Our engineering expertise combined with our extensive knowledge of CATIA (CAD software) ensures that the virtual part will be optimized for performance, cost and weight.</p>
          <p>Our User-Centric Design approach allows us to create an extremely efficient 3D model, a key element in today’s fast productivity world. This is accomplished by using our design methodology, allowing a CATIA designer of any skill level, to modify a model effectively and rapidly. The increased efficiency reduces frustrations usually associated with design evolution/iteration for our customer.</p>
          <p>Our team has more than 130 years of combined experience in Body Structure and Exterior design. We have designed structures and components for multiple Car and Truck of the Year awarded vehicles. One of those structures received the PACE Award for new technology. Several vehicles in past and current production share patented awarded designs.</p>
          <p>We understand how to create the most efficient design considering performance, weight and cost/investment.</p>
